* proper frames
  - user-defined functions (DONE)
  - recursive functions
  - coroutines
  - stacktraces
* new types
  - list
  - set
  - map
* variables
  - scope rules: LG (to simplify python's LEGB: remove E, combine G+B)
* classes (lazy records)
* cond (to generalize if)
* loops, while
* code objects (first class expressions? but not call-by-name)
* tier1: bytecode
* begin (to evaluate a sequence of expressions)
* treat top-level expressions better

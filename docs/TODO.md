# Todos

* proper frames
  - recursive functions
  - coroutines (Generators)
  - stacktraces
* new types
  - list
  - set
  - map
* variables
  - scope rules: LG (to simplify python's LEGB: remove E, combine G+B)
* classes (lazy records)
* for loop
* code objects (first class expressions? but not call-by-name)
* tier1: bytecode
* treat top-level expressions better
* example programs, benchmarks
* arbitrary precision integers?
* better parsing for integers
* clarify rules between syntax objects, literals, and built-in identifiers

* frame and code objects?

; example of classes, fields, and methods

(class Poop  ; this evaluates to a class which can be instantiated
  (field x 1)	; field called x
  (field y 2)   ; field called y
  (method (both)  ; method called `both` but it is also a field
    (+ self.x self.y)
  )
)

(new Poop)	; instantiates class
(set x (new Poop))

x.x; x.x is shorthand for (get-field x x)
x.y

(set-field x x 3)
x.x

x.both     ; accessing method
(x.both)   ; accessing then calling field
